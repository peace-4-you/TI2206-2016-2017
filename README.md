# TI2206-2016-2017

This is a Software Engineering Methods course project given at TUdelft. The project objective is to create a functional game during the period of entire course.  

The following Java Code Conventions can be used for this project:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-139411.html#16711

Instruction for writing/testing new code:
1. Create a new branch from master (if not already) for each team group. Give this branch an descriptive name about the task/goal. 
2. Create another branch if the task/goal can be seperated into smaller sub-tasks.
3. Write your code in this branch.
4. Once the code is completed, create a pull request. You may continue to work on the same branch on the SAME task.
5. One of the team member can approve your pull request after he/she has reviewed the code and found no bugs, invalid code conventions      and such in the code. The author him/herself is not allowed to approve his/her own pull request. 
6. If the pull request is not approved, the reviewer must write a comment stating why the request is not approved and what needs to         change.
7. The author makes the necessary changes and creates a new pull request. The old pull request is automatically removed.
8. Step 5-6 is repeated.
9. The author can work on other tasks while waiting for the approval of the pull request; starting at step 1.

NOTE: the master branch may only contain the release version of the game!
